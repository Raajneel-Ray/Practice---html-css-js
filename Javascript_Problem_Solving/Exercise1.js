// Exercise 1: Calculate total sales amount
/**Problem:
You are working for an online store. Your task is to write a JavaScript code snippet that calculates the total sales amount for a given set of sales transactions.

Input details:

An array of objects representing sales transactions. Each object has the following properties:
item: Name of the product (string)
quantity: Number of units sold (integer)
price: Price per unit (float)

Output details:

A single number representing the total sales amount

Steps to implement:

Define an array of sales transactions with at least 3 sample objects
Write a function calculateTotalSales that takes this array as input
Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the total sales amount
Print the total sales amount to the console */

const sales = [{item : "Laptop", quantity : 1, price : 50000},
    {item : "Mobile", quantity : 5, price : 20000},
    {item : "Headphone", quantity : 2, price : 1000}
]

function calculateTotalSalaries(sales) {
    let total = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i<sales.length; i++) {
        total+= sales[i].quantity * sales[i].price;
    }
    return total;
}

console.log("Total Sales Amount : ", calculateTotalSalaries(sales));

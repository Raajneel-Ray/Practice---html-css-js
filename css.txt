Types of CSS and Their Descriptions

Inline CSS

Applied directly within an HTML element's style attribute
Ideal for quick styling of a single element
Example use case: Highlighting a specific word or line with unique styling
Pros: Simple to use for small changes
Cons: Difficult to maintain for larger projects; violates separation of content and style

Internal CSS

Defined within the <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document
Best for styling specific to a single HTML page
Example use case: Designing a webpage where styles aren't shared across multiple pages
Pros: Allows centralized styling for one document
Cons: Not reusable across multiple files

External CSS

Written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using a <link> tag
Preferred for websites with multiple pages requiring consistent styling
Example use case: Large websites where styles are shared across pages
Pros: Promotes reusability and cleaner code; separation of concerns
Cons: Requires an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file

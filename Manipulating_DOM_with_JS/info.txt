Introduction
    The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document as an object, 
    allowing you to interact with and modify the content, structure, and styles of web pages dynamically. 
    JavaScript provides various DOM manipulation methods that enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. In this lab, you will learn how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to build a to-do list application.

Objectives
    By the end of this lab, you will:

    Understand how to use DOM manipulation methods such as document.createElement(), appendChild(), and removeChild()
    Add, edit, and remove elements dynamically on a web page
    Create an interactive to-do list application where tasks can be managed in real time
